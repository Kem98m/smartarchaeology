autonomous system that can navigate itself on sites using computer vision

The guide for set up is found in the f1tenth.org website and the research projects done on this topic

We used similar methods and are adding the use of a depth camera. An algorithm will be constructed in which the robot will detect and avoid obstacles such as holes.

### depthsense
Corresponds to code that leverages the Intel Realsense camera for point-cloud generation.
### lidar
Corresponds to code that leverages the Velodyne LIDAR sensor for point-cloud generation.

# Smart Archaeology
A project group to work on developing the technology for autonomous exploration. This work hopes to achieve a means of safer and more accurate mapping of dangerous excavation sites. With sites that are unstable or partially collapsed ruins, we hope to be able to send robots that can document these areas. We do this using a rover and various sensors such as a lidar and depth camera to accurately map and record. This repo hopes to document our efforts and progress for others to base their work on.

Two rovers are being used in this project. A built from scratch rover following the guidelines found in the [f1tenth](http://f1tenth.org/build.html). Much of our inspiration and system breakdown used ideas from [Autonomous Robots Lab](https://www.autonomousrobotslab.com/autonomous-navigation-and-exploration.html).

Alogrithms and project details will be found in their respective folders with the README containing record of how it was used. 

### depthsense
Corresponds to code that leverages the Intel Realsense camera for point-cloud generation.
### lidar
Corresponds to code that leverages the Velodyne LIDAR sensor for point-cloud generation.

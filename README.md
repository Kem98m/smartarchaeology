# Smart Archaeology
A project group to work on developing the technology for autonomous exploration. This work hopes to achieve a means of safer and more accurate mapping of dangerous excavation sites. With sites that are unstable or partially collapsed ruins, we hope to be able to send robots that can document these areas. We do this using a rover and various sensors such as a lidar and depth camera to accurately map and record.

Two rovers are being used in this project. A built from scratch rover following the guidelines found in the f1tenth website seen below.

#### [Autonomous Robots Lab](https://www.autonomousrobotslab.com/autonomous-navigation-and-exploration.html)

We used similar methods and are adding the use of a depth camera. An algorithm will be constructed in which the robot will detect and avoid obstacles such as holes.

### depthsense
Corresponds to code that leverages the Intel Realsense camera for point-cloud generation.
### lidar
Corresponds to code that leverages the Velodyne LIDAR sensor for point-cloud generation.
